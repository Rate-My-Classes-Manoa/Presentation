# Big Picture
Problem: There is no university dedicated review of classes for students. And during covid, users don't have any good ways to look at what events are coming up. <br>
Solution: Our solution is to create a personalized review page made by fellow students with a seperate page that lets users post upcoming events.  <br>
Outline:
<ul>
  <li> Users are able to post events to the community event page without logging in. </li>
  <li> Visitors are able to view reviews without logging in. </li>
  <li> To post/edit reviews about classes, users will need to login. </li>
</ul>
