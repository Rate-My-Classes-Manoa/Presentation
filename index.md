### Seth Tanoue

This will be my first time doing a coding project with multiple people. So figuring out the logistics of this project will be enlightening. Also, this project will be the first practical application of what we learned so far and I am curious on how much I have retained.

### Tony Long
I want to practice building web pages and web applications, such as learning more about api’s

### Ujjwal Gautam
I'm looking forward to building a reactive web page from scratch. I want to level up my understanding of the client and server-side interactivity.

### Mark Young
I’d like to learn about creating software as a team, and how to make a structure for completing a project.
