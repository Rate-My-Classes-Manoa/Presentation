### Seth Tanoue

<b>hopes & dreams:</b> This will be my first time doing a coding project with multiple people. So figuring out the logistics of this project will be enlightening. Also, this project will be the first practical application of what we learned so far and I am curious on how much I have retained.

<b>background:</b> I have worked with databases like SQL and MongoDB as well as a few servers. I excel at menial tasks. If you give me a task list I will try to finish it as fast as possible.
